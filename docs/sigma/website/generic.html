								<h2>Reflector and Compressor</h2>
								<p>This component has two purposes: as a reflector, it recieves the signals from the rotors and sends it back into the rotors to scramble the signal again. As a compressor, it has a threaded nut and bolt that can be used to compress the rotors together, ensuring good contact between the pins.</p>
								<h3>Reflector</h3>
								<p>The reflector is a set of 26 copper pins that engage with the spring-loaded pins of a rotor. These are press-fit into a 3d printed PLA housing. The pins are each soldered together in pairs so that when a signal comes in from a rotor, it is sent back into the rotors through a different pin. <p>
								<h3>Compressor</h3>
								<p>The compressor is composed of three parts: The 3d printed housing, an aluminum nut, the threaded end of our axle, and an acrylic rectangle. The housing slides into the reflector, applying force on it and the rotors. The housing has a hole that was made to fit the nut inside. The nut was made from a small block of aluminum we found. The hole was made with a drill-press, then threaded with an m7 tap to match the 7mm shaft. The end of the shaft was threaded with an m7 die. About an inch and a half of the shaft was threaded so that when the nut was threaded onto the shaft, enough shaft stuck out to go through the hole in the casing, holding up the shaft. The acrylic rectangle sits around the outside of the reflector and braces against the walls of the case, keeping the reflector aligned. </p>
